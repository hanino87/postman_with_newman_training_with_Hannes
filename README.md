ðŸ”¸ Step 2: Install Newman Globally

 ```Shell

npm install -g newman

```

## ðŸ”¹ 4. Starting Uvicorn-servern before running Newman

 ```Shell

uvicorn your_app_module:app --reload

```

Replace your_app_module:app with your actual module and app instance.

The --reload flag enables auto-reloading when code changes (optional).

The server will now be running, typically on http://127.0.0.1:8000.

 ```Shell

newman run your-collection-name.json

```

```
ðŸ”¸ Step 8: Run Your Postman Enviorment Collection and create a Pretty HTML Report for Newman 

```Shell

newman run your-collection-name.json -r htmlextra

```

The HTML report will be saved in the newman directory by default.

ðŸ”¸ Optional: Customize Output Location

```Shell

newman run your-collection-name.json -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-export reports/report.html


```

This saves the report as report.html inside the reports folder.
